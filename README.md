# Open Alchemy 🧪
This is a fork of an open-source project inspired by the game _Infinite Craft_.\
It is programmed in Python and uses the [NiceGUI](https://nicegui.io/) Python Library for the UI.
   * It uses Google's Gemini instead of Llama 2 like _Infinite Craft_

## Getting Started
In order to play, you need to set up ollama, and change the call in recipe.py to match whatever model version in ollama you want
<br />
Now you can run and play!
